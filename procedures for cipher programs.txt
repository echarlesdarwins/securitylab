PROCEDURE FOR CIPHER:

1.creating a cipher 
     U can create a cipher by calling its instance called getInstance() method
 
2.Initializing a cipher
     Initializing a cipher can be done by using init() method 
     init() method has two parameters - encrpytion/decryption cipher operation 
                                        encryption/decryption cipher key 

3.Encrypting and decrypting data
      To encrypt and decrypt data we can use these two methods 
            - update()
            - doFinal()

4.Encrypting / Decrypting Part of a Byte Array
       by using the encryption and decryption methods we can encrypt and decrypt the part of a byte array 

5.Encrypting / Decrypting Into an Existing Byte Array
       by using the update() and dofinal() methods we can encrypt and decrypt the part of a existing byte array

6.Reusing a Cipher Instance
       by reusing the cipher instance we can encrypt and decrypt more data again
